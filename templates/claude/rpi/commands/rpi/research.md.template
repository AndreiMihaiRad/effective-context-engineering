# RPI: Research Phase

Research the following topic thoroughly before any implementation begins.

## Topic

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Explore the codebase** systematically — find all files related to the topic
2. **Document findings** with exact file paths and line numbers
3. **Identify patterns** — what architectural patterns are used?
4. **Map dependencies** — what depends on what?
5. **Note constraints** — what must not change?

## Output

Create a file `research-[topic].md` with:

```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

## Key Files
- `path/to/file.ts` (lines X-Y) — [what it does]
- `path/to/file.ts` (lines X-Y) — [what it does]

## Architecture Pattern
[Describe the pattern used]

## Dependencies
[What depends on what]

## Constraints
[Things that must not change]

## Open Questions
[Anything unclear that needs human input]
```

## Constraints

- Do NOT implement anything — research only
- Be thorough — missing a file now costs 10x later
- Include line numbers for all references
- Flag anything ambiguous for human review
