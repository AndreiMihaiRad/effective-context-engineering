# RPI: Implement Phase

Implement changes following the approved plan.

## Plan File

Read the plan for: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Read the plan file** created in the planning phase
2. **Implement changes** exactly as specified in the plan
3. **Mark progress** — update the plan with [DONE] markers
4. **Write tests** as specified in the plan
5. **Run verification** checklist when complete

## Process

For each item in the plan:
1. Read the plan entry
2. Make the change
3. Mark as [DONE] in the plan file
4. If context approaches 50%, compact progress and continue

## Constraints

- Follow the plan exactly — deviations require noting WHY
- Monitor context with /cost — compact at 50%
- Write tests as you go, not at the end
- If you discover something the plan missed, note it but don't deviate
- Run tests after each significant change

## On Completion

Update the plan file with final status:
```markdown
## Status: COMPLETE

### Deviations from Plan
- [Any changes from the original plan and why]

### Verification
- [x] All planned changes implemented
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] No breaking changes introduced
```
